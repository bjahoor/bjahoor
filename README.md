## About

I'm a Robotics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo with experience working across software, hardware, and perception in modern robotic systems. I enjoy building reliable, well-structured systems and exploring how different components—sensing, control, and behavior—fit together to create intelligent robots.


I like:

* Building and organizing ROS2-based systems
* Working with sensors and robot systems
* Exploring control, behavior, and system structure

---

## Projects

Some areas I've worked on include:

* Legged robots and multi‑DOF motion systems
* Autonomous rovers and simulation environments
* Perception pipelines using cameras and onboard AI models
* Navigation, mapping, and path‑planning tools
* Swarm robotics and distributed systems
* Custom ROS2 packages for sensors, control, and system structure
