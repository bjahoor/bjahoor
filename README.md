## About

I'm a Robotics Engineering student who enjoys working across the full robotics stack - combining sensing, control, software, and hardware to build systems that behave intelligently in the real world. I like taking on projects where multiple components come together and where thoughtful structure makes robots more capable, reliable, and adaptable.

Areas I enjoy working on:

* Designing and organizing ROS2-based systems
* Integrating sensors and building diverse robotic components
* Exploring control, autonomy, and system behaviour

---

## Projects

Some areas I've explored through teams and personal projects include:

* Legged robots and multi‑DOF motion systems
* Autonomous rovers and simulation environments
* Perception pipelines with cameras and onboard AI models
* Navigation, mapping, and path‑planning tools
* Swarm robots and distributed coordination
* Custom ROS2 software for sensing, control, and system structure
