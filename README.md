## 🚀 About

I'm a Robotics Engineering student who enjoys working across the full robotics stack — combining sensing, control, software, and hardware to build systems that behave intelligently in the real world. I like taking on projects where multiple components come together and where thoughtful structure helps robots become more capable, reliable, and adaptable.

**Areas I enjoy working on**
- 🧩 Designing and organizing ROS2-based systems  
- 🔌 Integrating sensors and building diverse robotic components  
- 🧭 Exploring control, autonomy, and system behaviour

## 🛠️ Projects

Some areas I've explored through teams and personal projects include:
- 🦿 Legged robots and multi-DOF motion systems  
- 🚙 Autonomous rovers and simulation environments  
- 🎥 Perception pipelines with cameras and onboard AI models  
- 🗺️ Navigation, mapping, and path-planning tools  
- 🤝 Swarm robots and distributed coordination  
- 🧪 Custom ROS2 software for sensing, control, and system structure
