## 🚀 About

I'm a Mechatronics Engineering student with a strong focus on robotics. I enjoy working across the full robotics stack — combining sensing, control, software, and hardware to build systems that behave intelligently in the real world. I like taking on projects where multiple components come together and where thoughtful structure makes robots more capable, reliable, and adaptable.

I’m especially interested in <span style="color:#4da6ff;">robotic systems</span>, <span style="color:#4da6ff;">autonomy</span>, and <span style="color:#4da6ff;">perception-driven behaviour</span>.

**Areas I enjoy working on:**
- 🧩 Designing and organizing ROS2-based systems  
- 🔌 Integrating sensors and building diverse robotic components  
- 🧭 Exploring control, autonomy, and system behaviour

### 🔍 Currently Exploring

- ROS2 navigation and planning  
- Jetson-based onboard perception  
- Multi-robot and swarm-style coordination  
- Better tools for debugging and visualizing robot behaviour

## 🛠️ Projects

Some areas I've explored through teams and personal projects include:

- 🦿 Legged robots and multi-DOF motion systems  
- 🚙 Autonomous rovers and simulation environments  
- 🎥 Perception pipelines with cameras and onboard AI models  
- 🗺️ Navigation, mapping, and path-planning tools  
- 🤝 Swarm robots and distributed coordination  
- 🧪 Custom ROS2 software for sensing, control, and system structure  

<details>
  <summary>📖 More about projects</summary>

  - Worked on legged, wheeled, and swarm platforms using ROS2.  
  - Built pipelines that connect perception to decision-making and control.  
  - Used simulation and real hardware to test ideas before deploying.
