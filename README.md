## 🚀 About Me

I'm a robotics engineer who enjoys building end-to-end robotic systems — from low-level control and hardware integration to perception, autonomy, and deployment.

I like working across the full stack of robotics:

- 🤖 Designing and integrating ROS2-based robotic systems  
- 🧭 Working on control, navigation, and system behavior  
- 🎥 Developing and integrating perception pipelines when needed  
- 🛠️ Building, debugging, and iterating on real robots  
- 📍 Based in Canada
