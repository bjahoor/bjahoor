## About

Robotics Engineering student interested in building systems that combine sensing, control, and intelligent behavior. I enjoy working across both software and hardware to make robots more capable in real-world environments.



I like:

* Building and organizing ROS2-based systems
* Working with sensors and robot systems
* Exploring control, behavior, and system structure

---

## Projects

Some areas I've worked on include:

* Legged robots and multi‑DOF motion systems
* Autonomous rovers and simulation environments
* Perception pipelines using cameras and onboard AI models
* Navigation, mapping, and path‑planning tools
* Swarm robotics and distributed systems
* Custom ROS2 packages for sensors, control, and system structure
