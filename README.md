## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Robotics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo who enjoys working across different parts of a robotics stack. I like building systems that are reliable, well-structured, and adaptable — whether that's integrating sensors, developing control logic, or creating tools that help a robot better understand its environment.

* 🤖 Developing and organizing ROS2-based systems
* 🛠️ Working with sensors, hardware, and robot bring‑up
* 🧭 Exploring behavior design, navigation, and system architecture
* 🎥 Occasionally working with perception when the project calls for it
* 📍 Based in Canada
