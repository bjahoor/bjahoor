## About

I'm a robotics engineering student who enjoys working across the robotics stack — from integrating sensors and hardware to writing software that makes robots more capable and reliable.

I like:

* Building and organizing ROS2-based systems
* Working with sensors and robot bring-up
* Exploring control, behavior, and system structure

---

## Projects

* **ROS2 Rover Platform** – A modular rover setup combining control logic, bring-up, and sensor integration as a base for experimenting with autonomy and behaviors.
* **Camera & Perception Tools (ROS2)** – Lightweight packages for handling camera streams and adding perception where it supports the overall system.
* **Portfolio Website** – A simple site to showcase my work and background.
