## About

I love building things that move, sense, and react to the world. Over time, that interest has grown into studying robotics engineering, where I get to combine software, hardware, and systems thinking. I enjoy tackling problems across the robotics stack and learning how each part contributes to intelligent behavior.




I like:

* Building and organizing ROS2-based systems
* Working with sensors and robot systems
* Exploring control, behavior, and system structure

---

## Projects

Some areas I've worked on include:

* Legged robots and multi‑DOF motion systems
* Autonomous rovers and simulation environments
* Perception pipelines using cameras and onboard AI models
* Navigation, mapping, and path‑planning tools
* Swarm robotics and distributed systems
* Custom ROS2 packages for sensors, control, and system structure
