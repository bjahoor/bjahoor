## About

I'm a robotics engineering student who enjoys working across the robotics stack — from integrating sensors and hardware to writing software that makes robots more capable and reliable.

I like:

* Building and organizing ROS2-based systems
* Working with sensors and robot systems
* Exploring control, behavior, and system structure

## Projects

* **Hexapod Robot (Jetson + ROS2)** – Co-developed an 18-DOF hexapod with robotic arm, onboard camera, teleop control, and integrated OWL-ViT zero-shot AI for real-time detection and autonomous following. fileciteturn0file0

* **Autonomous Rover Simulation (Gazebo + ROS2)** – Built a rover simulation with obstacle avoidance, goal-seeking navigation, ROS2 navigation stack, and an AI plant-detection module. fileciteturn0file0

* **AI Object Detection Pipeline (ROS2 + RealSense)** – Developed a compressed RGB-D streaming pipeline with local AI inference using OWL-ViT and real-time OpenCV visualizations. fileciteturn0file0

* **WATonomous Navigation Stack** – Implementing ROS2 navigation with A*, LiDAR costmaps, and Pure-Pursuit control inside Docker, visualized through Foxglove. fileciteturn0file0

* **Swarm Robots (HeRo 2.0)** – Assembled, programmed, and coordinated a fleet of ESP32-based swarm robots, supported by Dockerized ROS2/Gazebo simulation. fileciteturn0file0

* **3-DOF Robotic Arm (ROS2 + Raspberry Pi)** – Designed, 3D-printed, and programmed a colour-sorting robotic arm using OpenCV vision and PWM control. fileciteturn0file0

* **Personal Portfolio Website** – A simple website highlighting my robotics projects, experience, and background. fileciteturn0file0
