## About

I'm a robotics engineering student who enjoys working across the robotics stack — from integrating sensors and hardware to writing software that makes robots more capable and reliable.

I like:

* Building and organizing ROS2-based systems
* Working with sensors and robot systems
* Exploring control, behavior, and system structure

## Projects

I've worked on a range of robotics projects involving AI-enhanced perception, multi‑sensor systems, motion and navigation, simulation, and full robot builds. These include legged robots, rovers, swarm systems, robotic arms, and various ROS2 software packages.
